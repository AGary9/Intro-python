#1. What built-in function would you use if you wanted
# to print out data to a user? 

you would use the input function

#2. What built-in function would you use if you wanted 
# a user to pass in data to a program?

you would use parameters.

#3. Explain what complexity and abstraction are, then
# provide an example describing their relationship to one another.
# You cannot use the following examples because they 
# were shared in class; grocery/ electronics store, car, phone. 
complexity abstractions are like taking away the important feautures of something that needs it , for example ps5 , the ps5 has a harddrvie that have a specific amount of storation that it can go up to .
#4. What does it mean when you encounter a syntax error?
If you encounter a syntax error you will have to put the qoutation marks on each end of your sentece and the begining of it .
#5. What is a variable? Provide an example of a variable in code.

A variable is like a substitution to get your answer , for example 2+x=5 in this case x is 3 .
#6. Write a function in Python that when called will print out 
# your name.

Print('Ahmaj Gary')

#7. What is a function definition and a function call?

the definition of a function is something that works perfectly , a function call is bascically printing something seperatly and then at the end the computer puts it all together .
#8. Describe what each symbol means?

# = // single equal
1 =
# == // double equal
2=
# != // exclaimation equal
!=
#9. What will the output for the following code block be?
var1 = 1
var2 = 2
var3 = "3"

print(var1 + var2 + var3)


#10. What will the output for the following code block be?
listOne = [20, 40, 60, 80]
listTwo = [20, 40, 60, 80]

the output for the following codes are 20 .

print(listOne == listTwo)

# 11. Create the following python lists and include the following
# data types for each list:
# a- create a python list of strings. The strings should be items you
# can find in a book bag
             you would find books , paper , pencils , loose paper , binder ,and laptop

# b- Create a python list of floats. the floats should represent the 
# price of each item in a book bag from the previous list.

bokks mayber 5 dollars , a stack of paper mayber 2 dollars or a dollar , a binder might be 10 dollars , and a laptop is 100 dollars 
# 12. What are the Three (3) naming formats we use for naming variables, files, and functions?
booleans , sequence ,and text .
# 13. Provide a coding scenario where you would you use a comparison operator in a program?
less than or greater than , you could use that scenario .
# 14. Provide a coding scenario Where you would you use a logical operator in a program?
and or and not , you can use that scenario, 
# 15. Create a block of code where you would 
# use a comparison operator with the follwing data: 2 is less than 3
currentScore= 100
highScore=2300

# Bonus : What does the type() function do?
its tells the computer what you want it to print .
