# Async work Monday March 18th, 2024.

#1. Create a function that will count the number of characters in a string
# that is passed in by a user. The string value can be passed in either as 
# a paramter or by using the input function.

# You must be write down and explain how your program 
# works in complete sentences in order to get full credit. 

# 2. Use your notes, W3schools, and what we have learned in class to develop
# a simple rock, paper, scissors game. Your game should allow the user to enter a letter
# that will represent the values rock, paper, and scissors (ex. r = rock, p = paper, s= scissors).

# EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOTE
# at the top of you page write import random
# use the random.randrange(1,3) function to develop your random value logic 
# for your rock, paper, scissor game. 

# Please describe the steps you took, or if you weren't able to complete this activity,
# the steps you would've taken to solve this problem in complete sentences. 
# This must be completed in order to get full credit.  

# Keywords -  

#Function - A block of code that only runs when called.
#Characters 
#String -  Zero or more charaters written INside quotes.
#Parameter-  Names listed In the function.
#Input - When you put In data.
