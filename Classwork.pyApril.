Notes - Python Loops helps us repeat things over and over again.

While Loop - A while loop Is a type of loop that will rerpeat a set of Instructions so long as the looping condition Is true.

For Loop - A for the loop Is a type that will loop through a group of data , such as a list dictionary or string.

How we would write a for Loop - 

# FOR LOOP - A Construct that will reapeat a set of Instructions
# for a list / Group of data.

birdgame = [ ' duck' , ' duck ' , ' duck ' ,  ' goose ' , ' duck ' , ' duck ']

for x  bird in birdGame : 
    Print(x)

    while x == birdgame [0]: # While loops will run forever for a list / group of data - For loops will only run up to the items in the group - While loops will run forever as long as the conditon Is true.
          Print(x)
