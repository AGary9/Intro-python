# 1. In your own words, describe what the difference
# between a function arguement and a function parameter.
# Write your response using complete sentences.

# The difference between a function arguement and a function parameter is that you can add as many put paremters as you want but you have to seperate them with a coma each ,  In function parememter you cannot do that.

# 2. In your own words, describe what each of the following errors means.
# Write your response using complete sentences.

# syntax error

# A syntax error Is bascically the way you say something to the computer Is Incorrect.

# type error

# A type error Is a error of which theres a squiggly line under and you didn;t put the right reasources to make it a correct character. For example 
Well hello , # That Is a type error.


# name error

# A name error I believe is a error Is where you don't put your name or something the parenthesis correctly and you get a error by not doing that.


# 3. What function would I use if I wanted to convert an integer data type into 
# a string data type?

#  You would use a NumPY function.


# 4. What function would I use if I wanted to change a float data type into a 
# an integer data type?

# You would use a sequence data type.


# 5. Describe three (3) Variable naming rules. Write your response in complete sentences. 

# One variable naming rule Is a variable name must start with a letter or a underscore character. Two - A variable CANNOT start with a digit. Three - There Is no limit on the length of the variable name.


# 6. Name the operator family each of these symbols are a part of 
# and describe how each of these sybmols are used. Write your response
# useing complete sentences. 



#symbols
# = # this Symbol Is from the assignment operator , this symbol Is used for telling the person what the variable can be or equals or the answer of something.
# == # This symbol Is from the comparison operator , this symbol means that what your doing Is EQUAL.
# =! # This is also form the comparison operator , this symbol tells you that what your doing Is NOT EQUAL.

# 7. You have been hired as an engineer to develop a car speed detection system.
# the car company would like to create a function where if the user goes over a certain
# speed it will notify them to change gears. The client has provided you with the following
# guidelines on how they would like the gear system to work:
# if the driver is going over 20mph, alert the driver to shift to gear 1
# if the the driver is going over 30mph, alert the driver to shift to gear 2
# if the driver is going over 40mph, alert the driver to shift to gear 3
# if the driver is going over 70mph, alert the driver to shift back to gear 1.
# the client would like you to pass in the speed that the user is going as an argument. 
# Please provide three (3) clues/ keywords and explain why you chose them to get full credit.

# 3 Keywords - 

# 1 - (Devolope) - I chose devolope because it lets me know I have to create something.
# 2 - (Function) - I chose function because it lets me know that I have to make a block of code (Some type of code) 
# 3 - (Certain) - I chose certain because this also lets me know that I have to know and find out the certain speed of the car.




# 8. You have been hired as an engineer to develop a fitness meal plan program. 
# your function should take in two (2) arguements; the day of the week, and the time of the day.
# depending on the time of the day; either morning or afternoon, the meal plan will change. 
# the client has provided you with the following meal plan information
# Please provide three (3) clues/ keywords and explain why you chose them to get full credit.

# Keywords - 

# 1 (function) - I chose function because I know I have to make some code.
# 2 (arguements) - I chose arguements because I know I am going to have to make a specified type of function in my program.
# 3 (If/else statements) - I chose this becuase I se depending in the question so now I know I may have to use if and else statements.


# monday morning= 2 eggs and an apple
# monday afternoon= bbq grilled chicken and broccoli

# tuesday morning= oatmeal with strawberries and blueberries
# tuesday afternoon= baked chicken with kale

# wednesday morning= fruit salad
# wednesday afternoon= curry goat with rice and cabbage

# thursday morning= pancakes and turkey sausage
# thursday afternoon= eggplant pasta

# friday morning= steak and eggs
# friday afternoon= cheesburger and fries

# saturday morning= oatmeal
# saturday night= baked chicken with string beans

# sunday morning = oatmeal
# sunday night = steak and spinach

# 9. You have been hired as an enineer to develop a school to develop an academic honors system.
# the client would like to check if the user has gotten above an 85% overall grade or has
# has accomplished passing the SAT. The client would like you to pass this information in as
# arguements. If either of these situations are true the student has made the academic honors list
# if only passing the SAT is true, congratulate the user but inform them they did not make the list.
# if they only scored above 85%, congratulate the user but inform them they did not make the list.
# if none of the conditions are met, inform them to continue studying and try again next semester. 
# Please provide three (3) clues/ keywords and explain why you chose them to get full credit.

#Keywords - 

# 1 (Boolean) - I say this because I see true in the question and booleans have to do with true and false questions , and I also see or.
# 2 (sequence data type) - I say this because I see list multiple times In the question and sequence uses list in its data type.
# 3 (Condtional statements) - I say this because it says if only , so now I know this will be also a If and else function as well.



# 10. Create a function that will check the temperature outside. If the user enters
# a number above 60 degrees it is warm outside, if the enter a number above 80 degrees it is hot outside.
# if the user enters a number below 50 degrees it is cold outside. and if the tempeature is above 50 degrees,
# tell the user it's not warm but it's also not too cold. 
# Please provide three (3) clues/ keywords and explain why you chose them to get full credit.

# Keywords - 

# 1 (Function) - I chose this because I know I have to make a block of code because it says create a function in this in the question.
# 2 (Conditional statements) - I chose this because I see if so this also tells me that I am using a If and else in this function as well.
# 3 (Comparison operator)- I chose this because I see below 50 degress so this tells me that I may have to compare something with something.
