import random

# 1. In your own words, explain the difference between an Python For Loop and a
# Python While Loop.

# A for Loop Is Iterated over a sequence of Items , While loop Is repeatedly executed.


# 2. Create a loop that will iterate over a list of numbers. For evey number in your loop,
# it should multiply that number by 3. 

# Keywords  - Loop  , For Loop to Iterate over numbers , Everytime or loop lands on a number  - Multiply by 3.
# List of numbers

numbers = [1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ,]

for number in numberslist: # for every Item in this list . . .
    Print( number *3) # multiply that item by 3  . . .



# 3. Use the following code snippet below to create a guessing game function. 
# The code below will generate a random number for you. You must write a loop that will
# ask the user to input their guess, if they guess incorrectly, the program will repeat 
# itself and ask the user to guess again. The program should continue to ask them to
# guess until they've gotten it correctly. Once they guess the correct number the program
# will congratulate them and the loop will stop. 

# Keywords - 

# Function - This tells me that I have to Instruct the computer to create something.
# Loop - This tells me that this will me a loop function.
# Input - This tells me that I have to Input data.

# Clues - 

# Program will repeat itself : if the number Is not corrct guess  , the program will repeat its self , well need to creat a function to store it , well use the Input function to toake the user guess.

def guessingGame():
    randomNumber = random. randit (1 , 10)
Print(f'Random number value is: { randomNumber}')
i = int( Input('please guess a number'))
    While condition is true: # While this Is true 
    # ask the user to enter a guess.
    # This loop will only stop when they get the answer correct.

WHile i == randomnumber: # While this is true . . . 
    Print('Incorrect guess, try again.')
i = int (Input('Please guess a number'))

# Generates a random number between 1 and 10
randomNumber = random. randit (1 , 10)
Print(f'Random number value is: { randomNumber}')


# generates a random number between 1 and 10
randomNumber = random.randint(1, 10)

print('Random number value is: {randomNumber}')
